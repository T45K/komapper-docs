## Overview {#overview}

The DELETE query is constructed by calling `QueryDsl.delete` and subsequent functions.

## single

To delete a single entity, call the `single` function:

```kotlin
val address: Address = ..
val query: Query<Unit> = QueryDsl.delete(a).single(address)
/*
delete from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ? and t0_.VERSION = ?
*/
```

Depending on the mapping definitions shown below, the SQL will reflect the appropriate values.

- `@KomapperId`
- `@KomapperVersion`

If optimistic locking fails during query execution,
the `org.komapper.core.OptimisticLockException` is thrown.

## batch

To delete multiple entities in a batch, call the `batch` function:

```kotlin
val address1: Address = ..
val address2: Address = ..
val address3: Address = ..
val query: Query<Unit> = QueryDsl.delete(a).batch(address1, address2, address3)
/*
delete from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ? and t0_.VERSION = ?
delete from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ? and t0_.VERSION = ?
delete from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ? and t0_.VERSION = ?
*/
```

Depending on the mapping definitions shown below, the SQL will reflect the appropriate values.

- `@KomapperId`
- `@KomapperVersion`

If optimistic locking fails during query execution,
the `org.komapper.core.OptimisticLockException` is thrown.

## all

To delete all rows, call the `all` function:

```kotlin
val query: Query<Long> = QueryDsl.delete(e).all().options { it.copy(allowMissingWhereClause = true) }
/*
delete from EMPLOYEE as t0_
*/
```

To allow deleting of all rows, you have to call the `options` function and
set the `allowMissingWhereClause` property to true.

When the above query is executed, the return value is the number of deleted rows.

## where

To delete rows that match specific criteria, call the `where` function:

```kotlin
val query: Query<Long> = QueryDsl.delete(a).where { a.addressId eq 15 }
/*
delete from ADDRESS as t0_ where t0_.ADDRESS_ID = ?
*/
```

By default, an exception is thrown if a WHERE clause is missing.
To intentionally allow deleting of all rows, call the `options` function and
set the `allowMissingWhereClause` property to true:

```kotlin
val query: Query<Long> = QueryDsl.delete(e).where {}.options { it.copy(allowMissingWhereClause = true) }
/*
delete from EMPLOYEE as t0_
*/
```

When the above query is executed, the return value is the number of deleted rows.

## returning

By calling the `returning` function after the following functions,
you can retrieve the deleted values:

- single
- where

Here is an example of calling the `returning` function after the `single` function:

```kotlin
val address: Address = ..
val query: Query<Address?> = QueryDsl.delete(a).single(address).returning()
/*
delete from ADDRESS where ADDRESS_ID = ? and VERSION = ? returning ADDRESS_ID, STREET, VERSION
*/
```

You can limit the columns to be retrieved by specifying properties in the `returning` function:

```kotlin
val query: Query<Int?> = QueryDsl.delete(a).single(address).returning(a.addressId)
/*
delete from ADDRESS where ADDRESS_ID = ? and VERSION = ? returning ADDRESS_ID
*/
```

```kotlin
val query: Query<Pair<Int?, String?>?> = QueryDsl.delete(a).single(address).returning(a.addressId, a.street)
/*
delete from ADDRESS where ADDRESS_ID = ? and VERSION = ? returning ADDRESS_ID, STREET
*/
```

```kotlin
val query: Query<Triple<Int?, String?, Int?>?> = QueryDsl.delete(a).single(address).returning(a.addressId, a.street, a.version)
/*
delete from ADDRESS where ADDRESS_ID = ? and VERSION = ? returning ADDRESS_ID, STREET, VERSION
*/
```

The `returning` function is supported only in the following Dialects:
- H2 Database
- MariaDB
- Oracle Database
- PostgreSQL
- SQL Server

## options

To customize the behavior of the query, call the `options` function.
The `options` function accept a lambda expression whose parameter represents default options.
Call the `copy` function on the parameter to change its properties:

```kotlin
val address: Address = ..
val query: Query<Unit> = QueryDsl.delete(a).single(address).options {
    it.copy(
      queryTimeoutSeconds = 5
    )
}
```

The options that can be specified are as follows:

allowMissingWhereClause
: Whether empty WHERE clauses are allowed or not. Default is `false`.

escapeSequence
: Escape sequence specified for the LIKE predicate. The default is `null` to indicate the use of Dialect values.

batchSize
: Default is `null`.

disableOptimisticLock
: Whether to disable optimistic locking.
Default is `false`.
When this value is `true`, the version number is not included in the WHERE clause.

queryTimeoutSeconds
: Query timeout in seconds. Default is `null` to indicate that the driver value should be used.

suppressLogging
: Whether to suppress SQL log output. Default is `false`.

suppressOptimisticLockException
: Whether to suppress the throwing of `OptimisticLockException` if an attempt to acquire an optimistic lock fails.
Default is `false`.

Properties explicitly set here will be used in preference to properties with the same name that exist
in [executionOptions]({{< relref "../../database-config/#executionoptions" >}}).
